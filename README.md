# AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System

A comprehensive cybersecurity solution that leverages artificial intelligence to detect and mitigate real-time security threats through network traffic and system log analysis.

## Architecture Overview

### Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming
   - Log collectors and network traffic monitors

2. **AI Processing Layer**
   - TensorFlow-based threat detection models
   - Real-time data processing and analysis

3. **Frontend Dashboard**
   - React-based user interface
   - Real-time threat visualization
   - Incident response management

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization and alerting

5. **DevOps Infrastructure**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes orchestration
   - Jenkins CI/CD pipelines
